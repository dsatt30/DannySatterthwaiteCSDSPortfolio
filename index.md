# Welcome to My Portfolio of Projects Completed During My M.S. in Complex Systems & Data Science at The University of Vermont

I completed the first stage of my academic journey last spring, graduating from The University of Vermont with a Bachelor of Science in Mathematics. During this time, I developed broad problem-solving skills that I was eager to apply more directly to the data-rich world we live in. This led me to pursue a Master’s in Complex Systems and Data Science at UVM—a renowned graduate program that bridges data science and computer science, equipping students with the tools, technologies, and frameworks to turn data into transformational insights and decisions in an increasingly complex, competitive, and interconnected world. With a focus on both technical rigor and practical relevance, my learning is grounded in the real-world application of creative problem-solving and advanced modeling techniques.

Through my studies and research projects (see links below), I have developed a solid understanding of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning. This foundation allows me to engage confidently with both current and emerging technologies. Coursework in Database Systems, Data Mining, and Advanced Algorithm Design has further sharpened my ability to design and implement robust data architecture strategies. My technical proficiency includes programming languages such as Python, Java, and SQL, along with a variety of data science tools and platforms. Just as importantly, I’ve learned to simplify complex systems and distill insights in ways that are tailored to specific audiences and use cases.

In summary, my academic coursework, technical skills, and research experience at UVM have prepared me to approach complex problems with both analytical precision and practical insight. I built a strong foundation in mathematics, a deep understanding of data science methodologies, and a commitment to translating complexity into clarity—skills that are highly relevant in today's data-centric world.
