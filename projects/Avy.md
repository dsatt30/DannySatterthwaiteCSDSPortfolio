# Chaos and Avalanches

This presentation analyzes the chaotic nature of slab avalanches using 20 years of data from Mammoth Mountain, focusing on the distribution of avalanche crown depths. By reconstructing the systemâ€™s attractor in three dimensions and applying chaos theory techniques, the study finds deterministic but complex behavior, suggesting that slab avalanches are fundamentally unpredictable in the long term
